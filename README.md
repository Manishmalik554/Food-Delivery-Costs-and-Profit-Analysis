# Food-Delivery-Costs-and-Profit-Analysis
This project aims to analyze factors influencing the cost and profitability of food delivery services. By leveraging Python for data manipulation and visualization, the analysis provides actionable insights into improving efficiency and profitability in the food delivery industry.

## Features of the Analysis

### 1. Data Preprocessing
**Datetime Conversion:** Converted delivery and order timestamps to calculate accurate delivery durations.<br>
**Data Cleaning:** Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values to ensure data quality.<Br>

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Profitability Trends:** Investigated the impact of various factors like commission fees and discounts on profitability.<br>
**Correlation Analysis:** Highlighted key relationships between variables using visualizations.<br>

### 3. Profitability Analysis
**Profit Margins:** Computed margins for each order to identify trends and patterns.<br>
**Impact Analysis:** Focused on how commission fees and discounts influence profitability.<br>

### 4. Visualizations
**Heatmaps:** Highlighted correlations between variables.<Br>
**Scatter Plots and Bar Charts:** Illustrated patterns in delivery efficiency and profitability.<br>

## Insights Gained
### Factors Affecting Profit:

**Commission Fee:** Higher commission fees reduced profitability for certain orders.<br>
**Discount Percentage:** Excessive discounts negatively impacted profit margins.<br>

### Strategies to Increase Profit Without Changing Order Volume:

Optimize commission fee structures to balance costs and revenues.<br> 
Minimize unnecessary discounts while maintaining customer satisfaction.<br>
Focus on orders with high profit potential to maximize overall profitability.<br>

## Technologies Used
**Python:** Pandas, NumPy for data analysis and preprocessing.<br>
**Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for creating compelling visuals.<br>
**Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive platform for coding and presenting insights.<br>
